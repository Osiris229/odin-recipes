                sized pieces, then do the same with 3 tomatos and 1 bell pepper as you did with the second onion.

                (This should take around 5 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>Next whilst your onions are cooking take your bigger cut Onions,bell pepper and tomatos and use a blender to blend them into a liquid.</li>
            <li>After your Onions have been cooking for around 5 minutes, add about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and mix it in well 
                with the cut onions and let cook for around 2 minutes.

            <li>Mix it well with the onions and paste and now add your seasonings to your likings.</li>
            <li>After having added the seasonings and mixing them well in, add some more oil and turn the heat dow to low to medium and close the lid on the pot and let the tomato based sauce
                cook for around 10-15 minutes. Until it has an intense red color and looks fully cooked.
